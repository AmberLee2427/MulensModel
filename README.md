# MulensModel

MulensModel is package for modelling microlensing (or $\mu$-lensing) events.

It is still under development. 

There is no tutorial yet, but we have a few useful resources:

* [Examples on how to use the code](examples/)
* [Instructions on getting satellite positions](documents/Horizons_manual.md)

More will be added soon.
