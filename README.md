# MulensModel

MulensModel is package for modelling microlensing (or $\mu$-lensing) events.

It is still under development. 

There is no tutorial yet, but we have a few useful resources:

* [Examples on how to use the code](examples/):
  * [Example 01](examples/example_01_models.py) -- plot simple point-source/point-lens (PSPL) model and model with planetary lens,
  * [Example 02](examples/example_02_fitting.py) -- fit PSPL model to the data,
  * [Example 03](examples/example_03_mulenssystem.py) -- define PSPL model using physical properties and plot the resulting magnification curve,
  * [Example 04](examples/example_04_einsteinring.py) -- calculate different paramters for a grid of lens masses and distances,
  * [Example 05](examples/example_05_MB08310.py) -- plot multiple datasets for a single model, plot the residuals, and do this both in magnitude and magnification spaces,
* [Instructions on getting satellite positions](documents/Horizons_manual.md)

More will be added soon.
