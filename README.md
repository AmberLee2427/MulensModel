# MulensModel
Microlensing Modelling package

We present a python package for modelling of microlensing events. The package aims to support a number of higher order effects: microlensing parallax, finite source, binary lens (with lens rotation), and triple lenses in future.

### Second order effects

TBD


### Model conventions

TBD 


### How do we develop the code?

We try to follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)


#### Naming conventions
* variables: underscore_separated
* constants: UPPERCASE_AND_UNDERSCORE
* functions: underscore_separated
  * function parameters: underscore_separated
* class names: CamelCaseFirstLetterCapitalized
  * properties: underscore_separated
  * private properties: _leadingUnderscoreAndCamelCase
  * methods: underscore_separated
