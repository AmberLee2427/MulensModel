Welcome to MulensModel's documentation!
=======================================

MulensModel is package for modeling microlensing (or :math:`\\mu`-lensing) 
events. MulensModel can generate a microlensing light curve for a given set of 
microlensing parameters, fit that light curve to some data, and return a chi2 
value. That chi2 can then be input into an arbitrary likelihood function to 
find the best fit parameters.
